# Portfolio-Assignment-1

## Description

Predicting house prices using an MLP model in PyTorch with data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Steps

1. Preprocess Data: Handle missing values, feature transformations.

2. Train Model: Normalize data, encode categories, train MLP.

3. Evaluate Model: Compute MSE, RMSE, and visualize predictions.

## How to Run

The current setup is designed for Google Colab. Create a folder in Colab, upload the file, and open it through the notebook. Alternatively, the code can be adjusted to run locally.
